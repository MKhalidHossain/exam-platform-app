//     answer is …. option B") got chopped, the audio sent to Whisper was
//     truncated, and the assistant "didn't understand" because Whisper
//     received "the answer is" with no answer.
//   * 2.5 s = production sweet spot. Long enough to bridge thinking pauses
//     without losing the snappy-feel — we additionally finalise early via
//     the partial-result endpoint timer in mcq_screen.dart, so the user
//     barely waits when they clearly stopped speaking.
